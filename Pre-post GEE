This file contains example code from a study looking at the effect of an intervention on the freqency with which 
children walk or bike to school. The study was a cluster randomized trial. We used GEEs in order to 
apply causal mediation techniques as mixed-effect models cannot accomidate mediation. Missing data
were handled with multiple imputation (code not included). 

NOTE: this study utilized an RCT design. If code is applied to an observational study, investigators
should likely not adjust for baseline levels of the outcome. See "When Is Baseline Adjustment Useful in Analyses of Change? 
An Example with Education and Cognitive Change" by Glymour et al in AJE 2005.

1. FORMAT MI DATA AS DATLIST
datlist <- miceadds::mids2datlist(imp.scored)

2. RUN MODELS FOR THE OUTCOME ADJUSTING FOR CONFOUNDERS, BUT NOT BASELINE OUTCOME LEVEL. CORRECT SE FOR
CLUSTERING
fit.lin.0=with(datlist, lm(freq_walk_diff~tx++age+boy+crace+dist_home_school+bmiz))
betas0 <- lapply(fit.lin.0, coef)
vars0 <- lapply(fit.lin.0, FUN = function(x){vcovCL(x, cluster = datlist[[1]]$chid + datlist[[1]]$school)}) 
model0<-summary(pool_mi(betas0, vars0))

3. RUN MODELS FOR THE OUTCOME ADJUSTING FOR CONFOUNDERS AND BASELINE OUTCOME LEVEL. CORRECT SE FOR
CLUSTERING
fit.lin.1=with(datlist, lm(freq_walk_diff~tx++age+boy+crace+dist_home_school+freq_walk_pre+bmiz))
betas1 <- lapply(fit.lin.1, coef)
vars1 <- lapply(fit.lin.1, FUN = function(x){vcovCL(x, cluster= datlist[[1]]$chid + datlist[[1]]$school)}) 
model1<-summary(pool_mi(betas1, vars1))

4. CREATE TABLE TO SHOW RESULTS FROM BOTH MODELS SIDE-BY-SIDE
#model 0
  tr0 <- createTexreg(
    coef.names = row.names(model0), 
    coef = model0$results, 
    ci.low=model0$'(lower',
    ci.up=model0$'upper)')

#model 1
  tr1 <- createTexreg(
    coef.names = row.names(model1), 
    coef = model1$results, 
    ci.low=model1$'(lower',
    ci.up=model1$'upper)')

#create table
screenreg(list(tr0, tr1), digits = 3, single.row=T, custom.model.names = c('Unadjusted for baseline', 'Adjusted for baseline'))
